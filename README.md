Timemaru タイムマル
Timemaru is a browser extension that combines your daily productivity tools with a fun, interactive floating companion. Manage your tasks and schedule while a cute pixel art demon floats around on your screen, ready to assist.

This project was developed as a proof-of-concept for a fully interactive browser extension using Manifest V3, pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

✨ Features
Timemaru is split into two main components: the Sidebar Panel for productivity and the Floating Companion for fun and quick access.

Sidebar Panel
The main interface for all your productivity needs, accessible by clicking the extension icon or your floating demon.

📅 Today's Summary: An at-a-glance view of your schedule and most urgent tasks for the day.

✅ To-Do List: A simple task manager with due dates.

🗓️ Weekly Schedule: A visual planner for your week.

☀️ Weather Widget: Real-time weather information based on a city you set.

⚙️ Settings: Customize your character's name and set your location.

😈 Unleash a Demon: Spawn more floating companions onto your screen directly from the sidebar.

Floating Companion (The Demon)
A cute pixel art demon that lives on every webpage you visit.

🖱️ Interactive: Click the demon to make it bounce and open the Timemaru sidebar.

🖐️ Draggable: Drag and drop your demon anywhere on the screen.

🍴 Predator Mode: When multiple demons are on screen, they will interact! The older demon will "eat" the newer one and grow in size.

🖼️ Image Hunter: The demon will occasionally get "hungry" and slowly move towards an image on the page.

❌ Banish: Right-click a demon to banish it from your screen.

🚀 Installation (Sideloading)
